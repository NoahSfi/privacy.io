## Project outline
Our final project will be to create a website for the **Privacy Committee** (soon X-Privacy). The goal of this website will be to have a calendar showing our events, having one site that explains why privacy online is important and another one which covers more private alternatives to many online services. 
Maybe we'll have one page comparing all different types of messaging services.
The following shall be added later:
- We will have one webpage which displays to you all the websites you have visited before coming here, and all other kinds of information we can collect about you (browser size, operating system, ip address -> location). We might have to implement Google services for this (we will see about this later).

## Details
The website will be structured as follows:
- Home
- Our Goals
- Online Data Collection
- Importance of Privacy
- Alternatives
- Events
- Contact us

### Home
