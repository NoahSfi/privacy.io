## Goals and Project Outline
Our initial project was to create a game similar to Hill Climb Racing. After several weeks of reading libraries that would allow us to use some physics, we decided that we might not have sufficient time to successfully complete this ambitious project. We therefore changed our plan to something more achievable for the given timeframe.

We finally decided on creating a website for the Privacy Committee (to be renamed as X-Privacy) of Polytechnique. Focusing on the HTML/CSS and Javascript part of the website, we did not focus on filling the entire website with actual content but used lorem ipsum for certain parts.

## Website Overview
The website has 5 pages:
- Home
- Our Goals
- Importance of Privacy
- Online Data Collection
- Alternatives
The general structure of the individual pages is fairly similar, except for the home page where we added some additional Javascript for the header image (blur and parallax scroll effect). 

## Facebook Login
Feel free to use the account given above to actually log in to Facebook and verify the information the website is collecting. We are getting everything from Facebook, even the random music links are personalized to this account.

## Libraries and resources used
The code used to connect to Facebook was found in the Facebook developer documentation, just like the Google Maps API. We had to adapt both to fit our website perfectly.

We used Bootstrap CSS to skip some basic redundant styling. This was used for the full-width containers, as well as for creating a table faster.

We had to search through Stackoverflow and the W3Schools website for topics we had no knowledge on.
