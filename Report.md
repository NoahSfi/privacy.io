# CSE104 Website
by Noah Sarfati and William Koch

## Goals and Project Outline
Our initial project was to create a game similar to Hill Climb Racing. After several weeks of reading libraries that would allow us to use some physics, we decided that we might not have sufficient time to successfully complete this ambitious project. We therefore changed our plan to something more achievable for the given timeframe.

We finally decided on creating a website for the Privacy Committee (to be renamed as X-Privacy) of Polytechnique. Focusing on the HTML/CSS and Javascript part of the website, we did not focus on filling the entire website with actual content but used lorem ipsum for certain parts.
